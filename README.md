## About Me

👋 Hello, I'm Vivek, an automation engineer currently working at TCS. Here's an overview of my skill set and experience:

- 💻 **Test Automation:** I have expertise in Java, Cucumber, Selenium, and Selenide for test automation, enabling me to develop efficient and reliable automated tests.
- 🔀 **Version Control:** Proficient in Git for effective version control and collaboration within development teams.
- 🚀 **Continuous Integration and Deployment:** Skilled in using Jenkins to set up and manage continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- ☁️ **Cloud Services:** Experienced with Azure for leveraging cloud services and deploying applications in a scalable and efficient manner.
- 🐧 **Operating Systems:** Proficient in working with Linux as an operating system for development and deployment environments.

In addition to these technical skills, I possess strong code reading and learning abilities, allowing me to debug code effectively and utilize documentation to successfully complete automation tasks.

Beyond automation testing and web development using Django, I have a keen interest in cybersecurity. I have knowledge of cybersecurity tools such as Nmap and Metasploit, and I have actively participated in basic Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like HackTheBox.

I am actively seeking a remote opportunity to collaborate with a team of highly skilled professionals. I am motivated to work in an environment that fosters positivity, a growth mindset, and encourages the exchange of innovative ideas. Joining forces with other bright minds in such an atmosphere is the ideal next step for me.
